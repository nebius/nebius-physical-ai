# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Cosmos e2e

- Validated Cosmos end-to-end on Nebius via serverless `train --smoke`.
  Run ID: `w13-cosmos-e2e-20260521T233523Z`. Output artifact:
  `s3://${NPA_S3_BUCKET}/w13-cosmos-e2e/w13-cosmos-e2e-20260521T233523Z/checkpoint.json`.
- Closes the 7/8 -> 8/8 Workbench tool verification matrix gap for the
  artifact-bearing Cosmos CLI workflow.
- Known constraints remain documented in `docs/testing/e2e-serverless.md`:
  NIM/Triton are not implemented, `finetune` is a placeholder, and deferred
  visual-generation/rendering paths still depend on the container EGL/DRI gap.

- Validated Isaac Lab bring-your-own-fork path: image override (Run ID:
  `w10-byof-image-only-20260520T232650Z`) and image+command override (Run ID:
  `w10-byof-image-and-cmd-20260520T233113Z`). Worked example at
  `docs/workbench/cookbooks/byof-isaac-lab/`. Checkpoint + sentinel:
  `s3://${NPA_S3_BUCKET}/checkpoints/isaac-lab-byof/w10-byof-image-and-cmd-20260520T233113Z/`.
- Fixed Isaac Lab train command construction to call the RSL-RL training script with `--num_envs` and `--max_iterations`; added SkyPilot single-job and parallel sweep YAMLs plus the Isaac Lab RL runner.
- Added BYOVM post-deploy SSH endpoint strategy persistence and transient SSH tunnel routing for live workbench commands; fixed GR00T S3 env injection/auditing, shortened BYOVM auto public health fallback, printed normal-deploy Hugging Face access status, suppressed successful FiftyOne readiness curl noise, and made template tests cwd-independent.
- Implemented demo pre-staging CLI fixes for shared credential injection, shell-safe and Docker-safe env files, BYOVM project storage inheritance, Hugging Face gated-model validation, BYOVM SSH health fallback, live status/readiness reporting, Cosmos progress output, GR00T gated-model fail-fast handling, FiftyOne video ingestion, deploy dry-runs, credential env audits, and cross-tool smoke-test scaffolding.
- Preserved Genesis BYOVM staging fixes with tests: EGL fallback for multi-GPU demo generation, Docker group/device access for Genesis containers, and BYOVM storage credential reuse.
- Added structured implementation prompts for the 14 NPA CLI demo pre-staging fixes.

## W9-W10 - Workbench maturity sequence

- fix(sonic): default serverless training to H100, not L40S (W12 condensed commit)
- feat(skypilot): `npa skypilot bootstrap/status/verify` with isolated venv
  pattern (W11 condensed commit)
- Isaac Lab SkyPilot orchestration validated end-to-end via BYOF runs
  (W10 condensed commit; see `docs/workbench/cookbooks/byof-isaac-lab/`)
- BYOF mechanism validated: image override and command override surfaces;
  worked example with verified S3 artifacts (run IDs in cookbook)
- Removed SONIC routing entry from `CONTRIBUTING.md` Known Deviations
